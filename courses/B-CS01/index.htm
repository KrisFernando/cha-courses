            <h2>What is Cyber Security?</h2>
            <p>
              Cyber security is all about protecting your computer systems, networks, and
              data from digital attacks, theft, and damage. Imagine it as the digital
              equivalent of locking your doors and windows to keep out intruders. In our
              increasingly connected world, ensuring the safety of our digital
              information is more important than ever.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="section4" class="learnsection">
            <h2>Why Cyber Security Matters</h2>
            <p>
              Cyber security is essential for several reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Protecting Sensitive Information: This includes personal data,
                financial information, and even intellectual property. For instance,
                you wouldn't want someone stealing your credit card details or your
                latest invention idea.
              </li>
              <li>
                Preventing Financial Loss: Cyber attacks can be costly. Companies
                and individuals alike can face significant financial setbacks due to
                data breaches and cyber attacks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ensuring Business Continuity: For businesses, a cyber attack can
                mean disrupted operations, leading to lost productivity and revenue.
                Think about how a hospital needs its systems running smoothly to care
                for patients.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Cyber Security Concepts</h2>
            <p>
              There are three main pillars of cyber security:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Confidentiality: Ensuring that information is accessible only to
                those authorized to see it. For example, an email can be encrypted so
                that only the intended recipient can read them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Integrity: Ensuring that information is accurate and has not been
                tampered with. An example is using checksums to verify that a
                downloaded file hasn't been altered.
              </li>
              <li>
                Availability: Ensuring that information and resources are
                available when needed. For example, ensuring that a website remains
                accessible 24/7.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Cyber Threats and Vulnerabilities</h2>
            <p>
              Before diving into specific threats and vulnerabilities, let's clarify what
              we mean by these terms:
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Vulnerability:</b> A vulnerability is a weakness in a system, network, or
              process that can be exploited by a threat to cause harm. Think of it as a
              gap in your defences. For instance, using weak passwords is a
              vulnerability.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Threat:</b> A threat is a potential cause of an unwanted impact to a
              system or organization. It represents the possible danger that can exploit
              a vulnerability. For example, a hacker trying to gain unauthorized access
              to your computer is a threat.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Attack:</b> An attack is an action taken to exploit a vulnerability and
              cause harm to a system or organization. It is the execution of the threat.
              For example, a phishing email that tricks you into revealing your password
              is an attack.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="section7" class="learnsection">
            <h2>Types of Cyber Threats</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Malware: This is malicious software designed to harm or
                exploit systems. For example, a virus that deletes files on your
                computer.
              </li>
              <li>
                Phishing: These are fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive
                information by disguising as a trustworthy entity. Imagine
                receiving a fake email from "your bank" asking for your account
                details.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ransomware: This malware encrypts your data and demands
                payment for the decryption key. Think of the WannaCry attack that
                affected healthcare systems worldwide.
              </li>
              <li>
                Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: These overwhelm a network or
                website to disrupt service. For example, a DoS attack on an online
                retailer might prevent customers from making purchases.
              </li>
              <li>
                Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: These intercept and alter
                communication between two parties without their knowledge. An
                example is eavesdropping on a conversation between your browser
                and a website to steal login credentials.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section id="section8" class="learnsection">
            <h2>Common Vulnerabilities</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Weak Passwords: These are easily guessable or commonly used
                passwords. Using "password123" for your email account is a classic
                mistake.
              </li>
              <li>
                Unpatched Software: Software that hasn't been updated to
                fix security flaws. For example, a company that does not update
                its operating systems regularly, leaves its systems vulnerable to
                attacks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Social Engineering: This involves manipulating individuals
                into divulging confidential information. For instance, a hacker
                can pose as IT support to trick an employee into revealing their
                password.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section id="section9" class="learnsection">
            <h2>Basic Security Measures</h2>
            <b>Strong Passwords and Authentication</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Creating Strong Passwords: Use a       mix of letters, numbers,
                    and special characters. Instead of using       "password123," opt for
                    something like       "5tR0nG!P@55w0rD."
                </li>
                <li>
                    Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): This adds an extra layer of
                    security by requiring a second form of       verification. For instance,
                    entering a code sent to your phone in addition       to your password
                    when logging into an account.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <b>Secure Communication</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Encryption: This converts data into       a code to prevent
                    unauthorized access. Using HTTPS for secure browsing       ensures that
                    data between your browser and the website is encrypted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): These enable secure connection
                    to a network over the internet. Think of       using a VPN to securely
                    access company resources while working remotely.

            <h2>Basic Security Measures - continued</h2>
            <b>Protecting Devices and Networks</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Firewalls: These are network       security systems that monitor
                    and control incoming and outgoing traffic. A       firewall can be
                    configured on your home router to block unauthorized       access.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software: These programs detect and
                    remove malicious software.       Installing and regularly updating
                    antivirus software can protect against       malware.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Regular Software Updates: Keeping       software and systems
                    up-to-date protects against vulnerabilities. The best       practice is
                    to enable automatic updates for your operating system and
                    applications.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <b>Backing Up Data</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Importance of Regular Backups: This       protects against data
                    loss from hardware failure, malware, or accidental       deletion. It is
                    recommended  that       you regularly back up important documents to an
                    external hard drive or       cloud service.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Types of Backups: There are full       backups, incremental
                    backups, and differential backups. Using a cloud       service to
                    automatically back up photos and files from your smartphone is       a
                    simple example.

            <h2>Everyday Cyber Security Practices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Safe Browsing: Avoid suspicious       websites and downloads.
                    Ensure you only download apps from trusted sources       like the Google
                    Play Store or Apple App Store.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Email Security: Recognize phishing       attempts and avoid
                    suspicious links. Double-check the sender's email       address before
                    clicking on a link or downloading an attachment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Social Media Safety: Manage privacy       settings and be
                    cautious about sharing personal information. Keep your       social
                    media profiles private and don't share details like your address or

            <h2>Cyber Security Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <b>Overview of Essential Tools</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Firewalls: These protect your home       network from
                    unauthorized access. A firewall can block malicious traffic       from
                    entering your network.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Antivirus Software: Regularly run       antivirus scans to detect
                    and remove malware. Programs like Norton and       McAfee are popular
                    choices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Encryption Tools: Tools like       BitLocker encrypt your hard
                    drive, ensuring that your data is safe even if       your device is
                    stolen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Password Managers: These securely       store and manage
                    passwords. Tools like LastPass or 1Password help generate       and
                    store strong passwords, so you don't have to remember them all.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Network Monitoring Tools: Tools       like Wireshark analyze
                    network traffic and identify potential threats.       Network
                    administrators use these tools to monitor for unusual activity.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <b>Emerging Technologies</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML): These
                    detect and respond to threats in real-time. AI can       identify
                    patterns and anomalies that might indicate a security threat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Blockchain Technology: This is used       for secure transactions
                    and data integrity. Blockchain's decentralized       nature makes it
                    difficult for hackers to alter data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Biometric Authentication: Using       biometric data
                    (fingerprints, facial recognition) for secure access.       Biometric
                    authentication is becoming more common in smartphones and       laptops.
